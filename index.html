<h2>Indiana State Museum</h2>
<p>The museum's collection was displayed in a spacious room on the third floor of the <b>State Capitol</b> building in 1888, but it did not remain there for long. It was frequently moved from room to room until 1919 when the collection was sent to a most inhospitable place, <b>the basement of the Statehouse</b></p>
